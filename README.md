PROJECT TECHNOLOGY:

i choose not not use frame work just to show case my efficience in logic and styling.

the ecommerce data is local and created by my self.

DATA MANAGEMENT LIB:
context api.

DATA STORAGE: local storage.
The item in cart are saved to local storage .
The users name is also saved to local storage, it is wrong to do so
as it exposes privacy, but i did so because is a frontend project with no backend and no data base.
