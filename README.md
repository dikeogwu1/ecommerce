# This project was biult without the use of any frame work or external material

i choose not not use frame work just to show case my efficience in logic and styling.
the ecommerce data is local and created by my self.

# Items added to local storage

The item in cart are saved to local storage .

the users name is also saved to local storage, it is wrong to do so
as it exposes privacy, but i did so because there is no data base.
