#### CRA Fix

```

"build": "CI= react-scripts build",

```

# This project was biult without the use of any frame work

i choose not not use frame work just to show case my efficience in logic and styling.
the ecommerce data is local and created by my self.

# Items added to local storage

The item in cart are saved to local storage .
The users name is also saved to local storage, it is wrong to do so
as it exposes privacy, but i did so because is a frontend project with no backend and no data base.
